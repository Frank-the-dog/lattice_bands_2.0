A lattice and band plotting program built on github.com/le-birb/lattice-bands by le-birb.

It plots the primative unit cells, Brillouin zone, energy bands, and density of states for any of the 14 Bravais lattices.

The abstract from the acompanying thesis:

Density functional theory (DFT) is one of the most common methods for calculating the electron states in crystal lattices. It is a good balance of 
computational efficiency and accurate results.  which is why it has become widely used. However, in comparison to the extensive efforts to optimize 
DFT and apply it in crystal databases, little attention have been given to student training tools.

This project provides students with a tool to explore the 14 Bravais lattices, their Brillouin zones, and simple energy bands and densities of state 
resulting from them. It can also compare the effects on the energy bands of a couple simple potentials. The naming conventions of the Bravais lattices 
and Brillouin zones are consistent with those used in DFT applications with high-throughput computations.

While other student tools focus on plotting the energy bands from a real crystal, this program shows the effect on energy bands of a theoretical 
potential changing across the unit cell compared to a uniform potential. It also provides plots of the Bravais lattice unit cell, Brillouin zone, 
and reduced Brillouin zone; so students can observe the relationship between them. Geometries which are fundamental to DFT evaluation and non-intuitive 
in shape, yet rarely shown in student education programs.
